# SaaS Readiness Roadmap

This document outlines feature ideas that can help the Tour Planner platform mature into a production-ready SaaS offering and unlock additional revenue streams.

## 1. Operational Foundations

- **Multi-tenant isolation** – Separate data per agency with tenant-aware database schemas or row-level scoping, plus usage-based quotas.
- **Billing engine** – Automate subscription billing with proration, dunning emails, tax/VAT handling, and self-serve plan upgrades or downgrades.
- **Usage metering** – Track monthly active users, itinerary exports, payment transactions, and API calls for overage billing or internal analytics.
- **Configurable branding domains** – Allow agencies to connect custom domains and white-label the traveler portal.
- **Audit trails & compliance** – Record immutable audit logs, configurable data retention, and compliance tooling (GDPR requests, consent tracking).
- **Role-based access control** – Expand beyond simple admin/editor roles to fine-grained permissions (finance, sales, operations, marketing).

## 2. Revenue-Driving Product Features

- **Marketplace upsells** – Offer premium supplier listings, curated experiences, or commission-based partner referrals that agencies can add in one click.
- **Dynamic packaging engine** – Bundle itineraries, flights, insurance, and add-ons with automated margin optimization and revenue-sharing opportunities.
- **Performance-based dashboards** – Provide revenue, margin, conversion, and notification engagement dashboards with benchmarking to justify premium plans.
- **Advanced automation** – Build drip campaigns, auto-follow ups, and lead scoring powered by AI to reduce manual workload for agencies.
- **Client upsell portal** – Enable cross-selling (room upgrades, experiences) through traveler self-service with transactional fees or revenue share.

## 3. Growth & Retention

- **In-app guidance** – Introduce onboarding checklists, tooltips, and contextual walkthroughs to reduce churn and support costs.
- **Public API & webhooks** – Expose agency-level APIs and outbound webhooks for integrations with CRMs, accounting tools, or custom apps.
- **Referral & affiliate program** – Track referrals, issue rewards, and expose shareable landing experiences to drive organic growth.
- **Knowledge base & support center** – Host product tours, FAQs, and embedded support chat for fast assistance.
- **Community features** – Curate a community forum or supplier showcase to keep agencies engaged and share best practices.

## 4. Enterprise Readiness

- **Service-level agreements (SLAs)** – Offer uptime commitments, dedicated support tiers, and incident communication processes.
- **Data residency controls** – Allow agencies to choose regional data storage to satisfy local regulations.
- **Single sign-on (SSO)** – Support SAML/OIDC for enterprise customers.
- **Export & backup tooling** – Provide automated data exports, backup restore, and encrypted customer vaults.

Each initiative can be prioritized based on target customer segment, expected revenue impact, and implementation effort. Combining foundational stability with revenue-focused features will make the platform attractive to agencies willing to pay recurring fees.
